## Troubleshooting: Contact Section Changes Not Visible

### The Problem
You're not seeing the new categorized contact section layout despite the code being updated.

### ✅ Changes Made Successfully:
The HTML file now contains:

1. **📬 Professional Contacts**
   - University Email
   - LinkedIn

2. **📊 Competitive & Data Profiles** 
   - GitHub
   - Kaggle
   - LeetCode

3. **📱 Personal & Social**
   - Twitter (X)
   - Instagram

4. **📞 Direct Contact**
   - Mobile
   - Personal Email
   - Location

### 🔧 Solutions to Try:

#### 1. **Hard Refresh Browser**
- **Chrome/Firefox/Edge**: `Ctrl + F5` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- **Safari**: `Cmd + Option + R`

#### 2. **Clear Browser Cache**
- Open browser settings
- Clear browsing data/cache
- Reload the page

#### 3. **Check File Location**
- Make sure you're opening the correct `index.html` file
- Path should be: `/my-portfolio/index.html`

#### 4. **Open in Incognito/Private Mode**
- This bypasses cache completely
- `Ctrl + Shift + N` (Chrome) or `Cmd + Shift + N` (Safari)

#### 5. **Force File Reload**
- Close VS Code/editor completely
- Reopen the file
- Check if changes are still there

#### 6. **Test with Live Server**
If using VS Code:
- Install "Live Server" extension
- Right-click on `index.html` → "Open with Live Server"
- This ensures you're seeing the latest version

#### 7. **Manual Verification**
Open the HTML file in a text editor and search for:
```html
<h3 class="category-title">📬 Professional Contacts</h3>
```

If you see this text, the changes are there.

### 🌐 For GitHub Pages:
If you've deployed to GitHub Pages:
1. Commit and push the changes to your repository
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild
3. Hard refresh your live site

### 🆘 Still Not Working?
If none of the above work, try:
1. Create a new HTML file with just the contact section
2. Copy the contact section code to test it isolated
3. Check browser developer tools for any JavaScript errors

### 📁 File Locations to Check:
- Main file: `/my-portfolio/index.html`
- CSS file: `/my-portfolio/css/style.css`
- Make sure both files have been updated

The categorized layout should show four distinct sections with colored borders and organized contact methods!
