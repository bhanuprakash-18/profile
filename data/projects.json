      "title": "Mask R-CNN Implementation",
      "description": "Implemented the Mask R-CNN architecture from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras for object detection and instance segmentation tasks. Preprocessed datasets like COCO and custom images, generated region proposals using RPNs (Region Proposal Networks), and applied RoIAlign for precise mask predictions.",
      "detailedDescription": "This project involved building a complete implementation of the Mask R-CNN architecture from the ground up. The challenge was to understand and implement every component of this complex computer vision model, from the backbone ResNet feature extractor to the final mask prediction heads. The implementation required deep understanding of convolutional neural networks, region proposal networks, and multi-task learning.",
      "problemStatement": "Instance segmentation is a critical computer vision task that combines object detection and semantic segmentation. While pre-trained models exist, understanding the underlying architecture by implementing it from scratch provides invaluable insights into modern deep learning techniques and enables customization for specific use cases.",
      "approach": "I started by implementing the backbone ResNet architecture, then built the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for multi-scale feature extraction. The Region Proposal Network (RPN) was implemented to generate object proposals, followed by the ROI pooling layers and the final classification and mask prediction heads. Extensive testing was conducted on the COCO dataset to validate the implementation.",

      "description": "Built a comprehensive simulation model to forecast the spread of COVID-19 across multiple countries using Markov Chains in Python. Collected real-world data from public health sources and applied probabilistic transition matrices to estimate daily infection progression.",
      "detailedDescription": "This epidemiological modeling project aimed to create accurate predictions of COVID-19 spread patterns using advanced statistical methods. The project involved extensive data collection from multiple international health organizations, data cleaning and preprocessing, and the implementation of sophisticated Markov Chain models to simulate disease transmission dynamics across different geographical regions and time periods.",
      "problemStatement": "During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an urgent need for accurate modeling tools to predict infection spread patterns. Traditional epidemiological models often failed to capture the complex, stochastic nature of disease transmission in real-world scenarios with varying intervention policies.",
      "approach": "I developed a multi-state Markov Chain model where each state represented different infection stages (susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered). Transition probabilities were estimated from real-world data and updated dynamically. The model incorporated external factors like government interventions, population density, and seasonal variations to improve prediction accuracy.",

      "description": "Developed machine learning models for fault and alarm detection in 5G network operations during my tenure at TCS. Conducted comprehensive EDA and time-series analysis on large-scale telecommunications KPI and alarm datasets to enhance network reliability.",
      "detailedDescription": "This enterprise-level project involved developing an intelligent anomaly detection system for 5G telecommunications networks. Working with terabytes of network performance data, the system could predict potential network failures before they occurred, significantly reducing downtime and improving customer experience. The solution combined multiple machine learning techniques including unsupervised learning for anomaly detection and supervised learning for alarm classification.",
      "problemStatement": "5G networks generate massive amounts of performance data and alarms, making it impossible for human operators to monitor and respond to all potential issues in real-time. Traditional threshold-based monitoring systems produced too many false positives, while critical anomalies often went undetected until they caused significant service disruptions.",
      "approach": "I implemented a multi-layered approach combining statistical process control, isolation forests for outlier detection, and LSTM networks for time-series anomaly detection. The system incorporated domain knowledge through feature engineering and used ensemble methods to reduce false positive rates. Real-time processing was achieved through Apache Kafka streaming architecture.",
